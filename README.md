Test Repository


So this is my figuring out how to fully navaigte GitHub before I go through and just further explore it myself becuase I have consistently found that that is almost always for effective nad effiecient for me. 
AFTER I have it figured out, I'll be uploading those projects that are patiently waiting for me!
I also love shoes.
